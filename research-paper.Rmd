# Introduction

## Background

Provide background information on your research topic. Discuss:

- The context and significance of the problem
- Current state of knowledge in the field
- Gaps in existing research
- Why this research is important

## Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are:

1. **Objective 1**: Describe your first research objective
2. **Objective 2**: Describe your second research objective
3. **Objective 3**: Describe your third research objective

## Research Questions

This study addresses the following research questions:

- **RQ1**: What is the relationship between [Variable A] and [Variable B]?
- **RQ2**: How does [Factor X] influence [Outcome Y]?
- **RQ3**: Are there significant differences between [Group 1] and [Group 2]?

## Hypotheses

Based on the literature review, we hypothesize that:

- **H1**: There is a significant positive relationship between [Variable A] and [Variable B]
- **H2**: [Factor X] significantly affects [Outcome Y]
- **H3**: [Group 1] differs significantly from [Group 2] in terms of [Metric Z]

# Literature Review

## Theoretical Framework

Discuss the theoretical framework that guides your research. Explain key concepts and how they relate to your study.

## Previous Research

Review relevant previous research, highlighting:

- Key findings from prior studies
- Methodological approaches used
- Limitations of existing research
- How your study builds upon or differs from previous work

## Conceptual Model

```{r conceptual-model, fig.cap="Conceptual Model", out.width="80%"}
# Create a simple conceptual diagram
# In practice, you might use DiagrammeR or include an image
knitr::include_graphics("conceptual_model.png")
```

# Methodology

## Research Design

This study employs a [quantitative/qualitative/mixed-methods] research design to investigate [research problem].

## Data Collection

### Sample

- **Population**: Describe your target population
- **Sample Size**: N = [number]
- **Sampling Method**: [Random, stratified, convenience, etc.]
- **Data Collection Period**: [Time period]

### Variables

```{r variables-table}
variables <- data.frame(
  Variable = c("Dependent Variable", "Independent Variable 1", "Independent Variable 2", "Control Variable 1"),
  Type = c("Continuous", "Categorical", "Continuous", "Categorical"),
  Measurement = c("Scale description", "Categories description", "Scale description", "Categories description")
)

kable(variables, caption = "Variables and Measurements") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```

## Analytical Approach

The analysis consists of the following steps:

1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate means, standard deviations, and frequencies
2. **Bivariate Analysis**: Examine relationships between key variables
3. **Multivariate Analysis**: Test hypotheses using [regression/ANOVA/other methods]
4. **Robustness Checks**: Conduct sensitivity analyses

### Statistical Software

All analyses were conducted using R version `r getRversion()` [@R-base].

# Results

## Descriptive Statistics

```{r load-data}
# Load data for analysis
data <- mtcars %>%
  mutate(
    transmission = factor(am, labels = c("Automatic", "Manual")),
    cylinders = factor(cyl),
    engine_type = factor(vs, labels = c("V-shaped", "Straight"))
  )
```

```{r descriptive-stats}
desc_stats <- data %>%
  select(mpg, hp, wt, qsec) %>%
  summarise(
    across(everything(),
           list(Mean = ~mean(., na.rm = TRUE),
                SD = ~sd(., na.rm = TRUE),
                Min = ~min(., na.rm = TRUE),
                Max = ~max(., na.rm = TRUE)),
           .names = "{.col}_{.fn}")
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = c("Variable", "Statistic"), names_sep = "_") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Statistic, values_from = value)

kable(desc_stats, digits = 2, caption = "Descriptive Statistics") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```

## Bivariate Analysis

```{r correlation-plot, fig.cap="Correlation Matrix", fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
cor_matrix <- data %>%
  select(mpg, hp, wt, qsec, disp) %>%
  cor()

corrplot::corrplot(cor_matrix, method = "color", type = "upper",
                   addCoef.col = "black", number.cex = 0.7,
                   tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45)
```

## Hypothesis Testing

### Testing H1

```{r h1-test}
model1 <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = data)
summary(model1)
```

The regression analysis reveals a significant negative relationship between weight and fuel efficiency (β = `r round(coef(model1)[2], 2)`, p < 0.001, R² = `r round(summary(model1)$r.squared, 3)`).

### Testing H2

```{r h2-visualization, fig.cap="Comparison of Groups"}
ggplot(data, aes(x = transmission, y = mpg, fill = transmission)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Transmission Type", y = "Miles Per Gallon",
       title = "Fuel Efficiency by Transmission Type") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

```{r h2-test}
t_test <- t.test(mpg ~ transmission, data = data)
print(t_test)
```

## Multivariate Analysis

```{r multivariate-model}
full_model <- lm(mpg ~ wt + hp + transmission + cylinders, data = data)

model_summary <- broom::tidy(full_model)
kable(model_summary, digits = 3, caption = "Regression Results") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```

The full model explains `r round(summary(full_model)$r.squared * 100, 1)`% of the variance in fuel efficiency (Adjusted R² = `r round(summary(full_model)$adj.r.squared, 3)`, F(`r summary(full_model)$fstatistic[2]`, `r summary(full_model)$fstatistic[3]`) = `r round(summary(full_model)$fstatistic[1], 2)`, p < 0.001).
